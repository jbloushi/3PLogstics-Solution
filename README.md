## 🔐 Default Credentials

For a fresh installation or development environment, the following default users are created:

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Admin** | `admin@demo.com` | `password123` |
| **Staff** | `staff@demo.com` | `password123` |
| **Client** | `client@demo.com` | `password123` |
| **Driver** | `driver@demo.com` | `password123` |

> [!TIP]
> Use these credentials to access different perspectives of the system. The **Client** user is pre-linked to the **Target Logistics Org** with a 1000 KWD balance.

---

## 🛠️ Maintenance & Reset

### Fresh Installation / Seeding
To populate a fresh database with the default users and organization, run:
```bash
cd backend
npm run seed
```

### Reset Admin / Passwords
If you need to reset the system to its default state or recover the admin password, simply run the seed command again. It will ensure all default users exist and reset their passwords to `password123`.

## 🚀 Production Deployment (VPS)

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or similar Linux distribution
- Node.js 18.x
- MongoDB (standalone or Docker)
- Domain name with DNS configured (optional but recommended)

### Quick Production Setup

#### 1. Generate Secure Credentials
```bash
node scripts/generate-secrets.js
```
This will generate secure JWT secrets and MongoDB passwords. **Save these values!**

#### 2. Configure Backend Environment
```bash
cd backend
cp .env.production.example .env
nano .env
```

Update the following **REQUIRED** values:
- `JWT_SECRET` - Use the generated value from step 1
- `MONGO_URI` - Update password with generated value
- `DHL_API_KEY` & `DHL_API_SECRET` - Your DHL credentials from [developer.dhl.com](https://developer.dhl.com/)
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Your key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - Set to your domain(s): `https://yourdomain.com`

#### 3. Configure Frontend Environment
```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.production.example .env.production
nano .env.production
```

Update:
- `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Same as backend

#### 4. Deploy with Docker (Recommended)
```bash
# From project root
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Update MongoDB password from step 1

docker-compose up -d
```

#### 5. Create Default Users
```bash
docker exec -it target-logistics-api npm run create-default-users
```

#### 6. Verify Deployment
```bash
curl http://localhost:8899/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","database":"connected"}
```

### 🔒 Security Checklist

Before going live, ensure you've completed:

- [ ] Changed all default passwords and secrets
- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production` in backend/.env
- [ ] Updated `CORS_ORIGIN` to your actual domain (not `*`)
- [ ] Replaced demo DHL API credentials with your own
- [ ] Replaced demo Google Maps API key with your own
- [ ] Configured HTTPS/SSL (use Let's Encrypt with Nginx)
- [ ] Set up firewall rules (UFW recommended)
- [ ] Configured MongoDB authentication
- [ ] Reviewed all `.env` files for sensitive data
